bReeze 0.2-0 [2013-02-06]
-------------------------

* clean: wind direction values are now excluded, where wind 
  speed is lower than the v.avg.min specified; 
  bug fixed - unwanted cleanings and wrong feedback possible; 
  repetitions can now be cleaned

* frequency: bug fixed - wrong frequency
  values possible for uncleaned mast objects

* plotDay: now all signals can be plottet

* plotMap: function removed from package due to disproportional 
  high installation requirements compared to the low performance 
  of the used OpenStreetMap package

* printMast: replaced by printObject

* printObject: new print method for all bReeze objects; 
  bug fixed in old printMast method, that returned wrong 
  availability values

* plotting functions (plotAep, plotAvailability, plotDay, 
  plotEnergy, plotFrequency, plotMonthStats, plotPC, plotPolar, 
  plotProfile, plotTimeSeries, plotTurbIEC, plotTurbulence, 
  plotWbDir, plotWeibull): many optional graphical parameters 
  added

* processing functions (aep, energy, frequency, monthStats, 
  profile, turbulence, weibull): new 'digits' argument for the 
  number of decimal places to be used for results; new 'print' 
  argument to show/hide results

* further small improvements of code and documentation; 
  name space added


bReeze 0.1-1 [2012-10-21]
-------------------------

* aep: capacity factor added to the output

* availability: two bugs fixed - slightly wrong availability 
  values in some cases of missing samples; error in calculation 
  for sets with just one signal 

* clean: wind speed limit for calculation of turbulence intensity
  can now be adjusted by the user

* createPC: if rated.p is not given, rated power is now
  automatically set to the maximum power value; desc argument for
  name and/or description of a wind turbine added

* formatTS: available patterns cleaned up and internal handling
  enhanced; possible error in pattern selection fixed

* plotTimeSeries: bug fixed - blocking of '00:00:00' time stamps 
  for the start and end arguments
