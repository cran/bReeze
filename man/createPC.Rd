\emph{Power curve}

A power curve characterizes the power production of a wind turbine and gives the amount of generated electrical power output as a function of wind speed. The theoretical power curve of a turbine is defined as:
\tabular{lll}{
	\tab \eqn{P \propto v^3}{P ~ v^3} \tab \eqn{\mbox{for} \ v<v_{rated}}{for v<v_rated} \cr
	\tab \eqn{P = P_{rated}}{P = P_rated} \tab \eqn{\mbox{for} \ v>v_{rated}}{for v>v_rated}}
Hence the generated power is proportional to the wind speed cubed, for wind speeds lower than rated wind speed. For higher wind speeds the generated power is equal to the rated power of the turbine.

Conventionally a power curve consists of pairs of wind speed and power in 0.5 or 1 m/s wind speed bins, starting at 0 m/s or the cut-in wind speed of the turbine and ending with the cut-out wind speed, e.g. at about 25 m/s.

\emph{Coefficients}

The power coefficient \eqn{c_p}{cp} is defined as:
\deqn{c_p = \frac{P_t}{P}}{cp = Pt/P}
where \eqn{P_t}{Pt} is the ratio of the electrical power extracted by the wind turbine and \eqn{P} is the energy available in the wind stream. According to Betz's law, the theoretically achievable power coefficient is approximately 0.59. However, no wind turbine will obtain this value, due to inefficiencies and various losses of the machine.

The thrust coefficient is a turbine specific characteristic and used for the modelling of wake effects. Therefore it is an important parameter for wind farm configuration.
